## Getting started

### Before you begin

Before you begin, you should have a basic understanding of the following:

- Take a look at the [contributing guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) to understand how to contribute to the project.
- Take a look at the [code of conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to understand how to behave in the project.
- Take a look at the [project structure](#project-structure) to understand how the project is organized.

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (v20.10.7 or higher)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (v1.29.2 or higher)

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Junqo-org/junqo-platform.git
    ```

2. Move to the project directory

    ```bash
    cd junqo-platform
    ```

3. Deploy the project locally using Docker Compose

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

### Usage

Notice, the following instructions are admitting that you are using the default configuration of the project.  
Furthermore, the project is running in production mode.  
You should replace *localhost* by the IP address of the machine running the project.  

- Access the web server at [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80) or [https://localhost:443](https://localhost:443) if using TLS.
- Access the back server at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
- Access the database adminer at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

- `back`: Runs the REST API server to communicate with the database.
- `front`: Runs the web server / Flutter app seen by the user.
- `docs`: Contains the documentation of the project.
- `docker-compose.yml`: The main file to deploy the project in production mode.
- `docker-compose.dev.yml`: The main file to deploy the project in development mode.

### Interactions

The following diagram shows the interactions between the different parts of the project:  

![
   +-----------+       +----------+       +------------+
   |   Front   | <---> |   Back   | <---> |  DataBase  |
   +-----------+       +----------+       +------------+
](../assets/interactions_diagram.png)

> Interactions diagram

The **front** communicates with the back using the REST API.  
The **back** communicates with the database using the database driver.  
The **database** stores the data.  

### Operation

The following diagram shows how the different programs are executed:

### Networking

The following diagram shows the networking of the project:  

```txt
External ports:   80/443              4200                5432                 3000
                     |                  |                   |                    |
               +-----------+       +----------+       +------------+       +-----------+
               |   Front   |       |   Back   |       |  DataBase  |       |  Adminer  |
               +-----------+       +----------+       +------------+       +-----------+
```

> Networking diagram

The **front** is accessible on the World Wide Web at port **80**/**443**.
The **back** is accessible on the World Wide Web at port **4200**.
The **database** is accessible on the World Wide Web at port **5432** (admitting that you are using Postgresql).
The **adminer** is accessible on the World Wide Web at port **3000**.

### API

The **backend** API uses **GraphQL** to communicate with the **frontend**.  
A schema is available at [/schemas/schema.graphqls](../../schemas/schema.graphqls).
Yous can find the API documentation at [http://doc.junqo.org/api/index.html](../api/index.html).

### Documentation Generation

The project uses **Magidoc** to generate the backend API documentation.  
The documentation is available at [http://doc.junqo.org/api/index.html](../api/index.html).  
The documentation is generated automatically when the project is deployed using Github Action.  

If you want to generate the documentation manually, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx @magidoc/cli@latest generate
```

The rest of the documentation is written in Markdown and is available in the [docs](../../docs) directory.
It is automatically generated into a static website using Jekyll and is deployed using Github Pages.
The documentation is available at [http://doc.junqo.org/developer/index.html](../developer/index.html).

Install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
bundle install
```

Update the `Gemfile.lock` file by running the following command:

```bash
bundle update
```

To generate the documentation, run the following command:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```
